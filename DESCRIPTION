Description: We developed RePACT (Regressing Principle components for the Assembly of Continuous Trajectory) as a general method to sensitively identify disease relevant gene signatures using single cell data. The key step is to find the best trajectory to rank single cells (e.g. Î² cells) reflecting the change of disease status. In this study, we used RePACT to study obesity (denoted by a continuous BMI variable) and T2D (denoted by a dichotomous variable T2D). It can be potentially applied to any other interesting phenotype
